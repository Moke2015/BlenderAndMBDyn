The elements section is the basis of the BAM software. You may create an element by clicking on the <img src="createElem.png" alt="+" height="22" /> button and choosing from the list. If you currently have a Blender mesh selected, it will become that element. Usually, one will start by creating a <a href="#body">Body</a>. Another common element which needs to be inserted is the <a href="#gravity">Gravity</a> element. The <img src="showFiltering.png" alt="+"  height="22" /> button will expand the menu to also show filtering options of the element list. The <img src="editElem.png" alt="inverse triangle"  height="22" /> button will allow one to edit an element or see a list of its users.

<a name="body">Body</a>:
<p>
The body element describes a lumped rigid body when connected to a regular, 6 degree of freedom
structural node, or a point mass when connected to a rotationless, 3 degree of freedom structural node.
If only one mass is defined, the first method should be used. Otherwise, many masses can be referred
to the same element by means of the keyword condense, followed by the number of expected masses
num_masses. The format of each sub-mass is the same as for the single mass input (actually, when
condense is not supplied, num_masses is assumed to be 1).
The inertia_matrix is always referred to the center of mass of the mass that is being added. It
can be rotated locally by means of the extra orientation_matrix supplied after the (optional) keyword
inertial. The keyword node corresponds to the default, i.e. the inertia matrix is assumed to be input
in the node reference frame.

<p>
The structural force element allows to apply a force to the selected element. It can be ither absolute or follower. And absolute force will always have the same position and orientation while the follower force will follow the object to which it is applied. The force value is defined by a <a href="#driver">driver</a>.

<a name="constitutive">Constitutive</a>
<p>
Implements the type ConstitutiveLaw. Every time a “deformable”
entity requires a constitutive law, a template constitutive law is read. This has been implemented by
means of C++ templates in order to allow the definition of a general constitutive law when possible.
The “deformable” elements at present are:
• rod and genel spring and related elements (1D);
• deformable hinge and deformable displacement joint elements (3D);
• deformable joint and beam elements (6D).
Constitutive laws are also used in non-structural components, to allow some degree of generality in
defining input/output relationships. Some constitutive laws are meaningful only when related to some
precise dimensionality. In some special cases, general purpose (genel) elements use 1D constitutive laws
to express an arbitrary dependence of some value on a scalar state of the system. Table 2.7 shows the
availability of each constitutive law.
The meaning of the input and output parameters of a constitutive law is dictated by the entity that
uses it. In general, the user should refer to the element the constitutive law is being instantiated for in
order to understand what the input and the output parameters are supposed to be

<a name="gravity">Gravity</a>:
<p>
The Gravity element is used to add a gravity force to the simulation. Many times one will want to define it as a constant drive with a value of 9.81 m/s^2. The gravity element does not get linked with any Blender mesh.
