The elements section is the basis of the BAM software. You may create an element by clicking on the <img src="createElem.png" alt="+" height="22" /> button and choosing from the list. If you currently have a Blender mesh selected, it will become that element. Usually, one will start by creating a <a href="#body">Body</a>. Another common element which needs to be inserted is the <a href="#gravity">Gravity</a> element. The <img src="showFiltering.png" alt="+"  height="22" /> button will expand the menu to also show filtering options of the element list. The <img src="editElem.png" alt="inverse triangle"  height="22" /> button will allow one to edit an element or see a list of its users. Double clicking on a name in the list allows to change the said name. In case of a name conflict when creating a new element, a number will be added to the end of the chosen name.

<a class="title" name="body">Body</a>:
<p>
A body represents a mass in the multibody model. It requires a mass value, which can be set as a variable name by ticking the checkbox. It also requires a <a href="#3x3">3x3</a> matrix of inertia.

If no Blender mesh is selected when creating a body, a new one will be created at the location of the cursor. Upon accepting the body creation dialog, the user is invited by the "Object specifications" dialog to modify numerically the position and orientation of the body. This is optional and, in any case, any modifications brough by the user to the associated Blender mesh will be also applied to the body.
<!--
The body element describes a lumped rigid body when connected to a regular, 6 degree of freedom
structural node, or a point mass when connected to a rotationless, 3 degree of freedom structural node.
If only one mass is defined, the first method should be used. Otherwise, many masses can be referred
to the same element by means of the keyword condense, followed by the number of expected masses
num_masses. The format of each sub-mass is the same as for the single mass input (actually, when
condense is not supplied, num_masses is assumed to be 1).
The inertia_matrix is always referred to the center of mass of the mass that is being added. It
can be rotated locally by means of the extra orientation_matrix supplied after the (optional) keyword
inertial. The keyword node corresponds to the default, i.e. the inertia matrix is assumed to be input
in the node reference frame.

<a class="title" name="structural_force">Structural force</a>:
<p>
The structural force element allows to apply a force to the selected element. It can be ither absolute or follower. And absolute force will always have the same position and orientation while the follower force will follow the object to which it is applied. The force value is defined by a <a href="#driver">driver</a>.
</p>




<a class="title" name="gravity">Gravity</a>:
<p>
The Gravity element is used to add a gravity force to the simulation. Many times one will want to define it as a constant drive with a value of 9.81 m/s^2. The gravity element does not get linked with any Blender mesh. Any type of gravity may be defined by combining the required vector input with a chosen driver.

<a class="title" name="simulator">Simulator</a>:
<p>
	This panel allows to run MBDyn. Only one simulation needs to be created. It can be ran multiple times. After after updated the multibody model, one can simply select the desired simulator and click the "Run simulation" button followed by the "Animated objects" button to see the new updated results.

<a class="title" name="constitutive">Constitutive law</a>:
<p>
This panel allows to define the laws used by the deformable joints.
<br><br>
<a href="javascript:showhide('constitutiveDetails');">Click to show/hide elaborate explanation</a>
<div class="elaborateHidden" id="constitutiveDetails">
Every time a &quot;deformable&quot;
entity requires a constitutive law, a template constitutive law is read.
The &quot;deformable&quot; elements at present are:<br>
- rod and genel spring and related elements (1D);<br>
- deformable hinge and deformable displacement joint elements (3D);<br>
- deformable joint and beam elements (6D).<br>
Constitutive laws are also used in non-structural components, to allow some degree of generality in
defining input/output relationships. Some constitutive laws are meaningful only when related to some
precise dimensionality. In some special cases, general purpose (genel) elements use 1D constitutive laws
to express an arbitrary dependence of some value on a scalar state of the system. Table 2.7 shows the
availability of each constitutive law.<br>
The meaning of the input and output parameters of a constitutive law is dictated by the entity that
uses it. In general, the user should refer to the element the constitutive law is being instantiated for in
order to understand what the input and the output parameters are supposed to be.
